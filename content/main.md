# Introduction

Welcome Code Crew! 

Your great interest of learning take you here. I will try to explain **PHP** in very simple word, hopefully that will be really worthy for you. 

Before begining of the tutorial please make sure you have some basic knowledge of programming language. If you are from the background of **Computer science** then probably you have the knowledge of **C / C++** which will be very useful to understand the basic. If you are from different background just keep learning hopefully your invested time will be worthy somehow at the end of the tutorial.

The **PHP** which stands for **Hypertext Preprocessor** is a programming language used to develop dyanamic website that interacts with databases. **PHP** is basically used for develop website / web applications. Also it's programming lanuage and use for application you can't use it for **desktop** application. It's completly build for website. Also **PHP** is called **server side language**. Which means you can use this lanauge in your website's backend to retrive or generate data to the frontend of the users. If you don't know what is **backend** or **frontend**, just keep learning, I'll teach you.
